RtMidi - a set of C++ classes that provides a common API for realtime MIDI input/output across Linux (ALSA & Jack), Macintosh OS X (CoreMidi), Windows (Multimedia), and SGI operating systems.

By Gary P. Scavone, 2003-2011.

v1.0.15: (11 August 2011)
- updates for wide character support in Windows
- stopped using std::queue and implemented internal MIDI ring buffer (for thread safety ... thanks to Michael Behrman)
- removal of the setQueueSizeLimit() function ... queue size limit now an optional arguement to constructor

v1.0.14: (17 April 2011)
- bug fix to Jack MIDI support (thanks to Alexander Svetalkin and Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas)

v1.0.13: (7 April 2011)
- updated RtError.h to the same version as in RtAudio
- new Jack MIDI support in Linux (thanks to Alexander Svetalkin)

v1.0.12: (17 February 2011)
- Windows 64-bit pointer fixes (thanks to Ward Kockelkorn)
- removed possible exceptions from getPortName() functions
- changed sysex sends in OS-X to use MIDISendSysex() function (thanks to Casey Tucker)
- bug fixes to time code parsing in OS-X and ALSA (thanks to Greg)
- added MSW project file to build as library (into lib/ directory ... thanks to Jason Champion)

v1.0.11: (29 January 2010)
- added CoreServices/CoreServices.h include for OS-X 10.6 and gcc4.2 compile (thanks to Jon McCormack)
- various increment optimizations (thanks to Paul Dean)
- fixed incorrectly located snd_seq_close() function in ALSA API (thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas)
- updates to Windows sysex code to better deal with possible delivery problems (thanks to Bastiaan Verreijt)

v1.0.10: (3 June 2009)
- fix adding timestamp to OS-X sendMessage() function (thanks to John Dey)

v1.0.9: (30 April 2009)
- added #ifdef AVOID_TIMESTAMPING to conditionally compile support for event timestamping of ALSA sequencer events. This is useful for programs not needing timestamps, saving valuable system resources.
- updated functionality in OSX_CORE for getting driver name (thanks to Casey Tucker)

v1.0.8: (29 January 2009)
- bug fixes for concatenating segmented sysex messages in ALSA (thanks to Christoph Eckert)
- update to ALSA sequencer port enumeration (thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabonillas)
- bug fixes for concatenating segmented sysex messages in OS-X (thanks to Emmanuel Litzroth)
- added functionality for naming clients (thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabonillas and Axel Schmidt)
- bug fix in Windows when receiving sysex messages if the ignore flag was set (thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabonillas)

v1.0.7: (7 December 2007)
- configure and Makefile changes for MinGW
- renamed midiinfo.cpp to midiprobe.cpp and updated VC++ project/workspace

v1.0.6: (9 March 2006)
- bug fix for timestamp problem in ALSA  (thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas)

v1.0.5: (18 November 2005)
- added optional port name to openVirtualPort() functions
- fixed UNICODE problem in Windows getting device names (thanks Eduardo Coutinho!).
- fixed bug in Windows with respect to getting Sysex data (thanks Jean-Baptiste Berruchon!)

v1.0.4: (14 October 2005)
- added check for status byte == 0xF8 if ignoring timing messages
- changed pthread attribute to SCHED_OTHER (from SCHED_RR) to avoid thread problem when realtime cababilities are not enabled.
- now using ALSA sequencer time stamp information (thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas)
- fixed memory leak in ALSA implementation
- now concatenate segmented sysex messages in ALSA

v1.0.3: (22 November 2004)
- added common pure virtual functions to RtMidi abstract base class

v1.0.2: (21 September 2004)
- added warning messages to openVirtualPort() functions in Windows and Irix (where it can't be implemented)

v1.0.1: (20 September 2004)
- changed ALSA preprocessor definition to __LINUX_ALSASEQ__

v1.0.0: (17 September 2004)
- first release of new independent class with both input and output functionality
